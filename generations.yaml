    description: "The Toyota GR Corolla represents the first high-performance variant of the Corolla developed by Toyota's Gazoo Racing division for the North American market, bringing serious performance credentials to the traditionally practical compact car. Based on the twelfth-generation Corolla hatchback but with substantial performance modifications, the GR Corolla features aggressive styling with widened fenders, functional air vents, a large rear wing, and triple exhaust outletsâ€”visual clues to its performance-focused nature. Powered by a turbocharged 1.6-liter three-cylinder engine (shared with the GR Yaris not sold in North America) producing 300 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque, the GR Corolla delivers impressive performance with a 0-60 mph time of approximately 5.0 seconds. A defining feature is the GR-FOUR all-wheel drive system offering three driver-selectable torque distribution settings (60:40, 50:50, or 30:70 front-to-rear), paired exclusively with a six-speed manual transmission featuring rev-matching functionality. The chassis features significant reinforcement with additional welds and structural adhesive, while the suspension has been completely retuned with unique springs, dampers, and stabilizer bars for optimized handling. Available in Core, Circuit Edition (2023 only), and limited-production Morizo Edition variants, the latter featuring increased torque (295 lb-ft), reduced weight, and additional chassis reinforcement. The interior combines the standard Corolla's basic layout with sport-specific enhancements including heavily bolstered front seats, a GR-specific steering wheel and shifter, and unique instrumentation including all-wheel drive mode indicators. Standard features include a JBL premium audio system, Toyota Safety Sense 3.0 driver assistance suite, and a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster. The GR Corolla establishes a new performance flagship for the Corolla lineup, appealing to enthusiasts seeking an engaging, rally-inspired driving experience in a practical package, while positioning Toyota more firmly in the hot hatchback segment against competitors like the Volkswagen Golf R and Honda Civic Type R."
